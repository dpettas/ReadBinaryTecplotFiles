# ReadBinaryTecplotFiles
In this repository I created a class that reads a binary tecplot file (*.plt)

In the bashrc update PYTHONPATH enviromental variable:

export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/module/ReadBinaryTecplotFiles"

# To Do 

Create an abstract class that is inherited to the binary class and ascii class.
